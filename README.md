# Open Group Contract v1.0

## What is it?

The **Open Group Contract** is an open-source group contract for teams and groups to use when working on projects or in a collaborative setting. It is designed to be flexible and adaptable to the group's/team's needs while maintaining compatibility with future versions.

## Why create an open contract?

Groups are often tasked with creating "norms and expectations" and may not want to reinvent the wheel with each group a person is a member of. As such, the Open Group Contract is a solution that freely lets you re-use it in any group for any situation without restriction of license.

## How to use

Using this contract is as easy as downloading the Open Group Contract and following the [section labeled "Usage"](./OGC.md#V-Usage)

This repo contains the plain text and Markdown versions of this license.
