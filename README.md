# Open Group Contract v1.0

## What is it?

The **Open Group Contract** is an open-source group contract for teams and groups to use when working on projects or in a collaborative setting. It is designed to be flexible and adaptable to the group's/team's needs while maintaining compatibility with future versions.

## Why create an open contract?

Groups are often tasked with creating "norms and expectations" and may not want to reinvent the wheel with each group a person is a member of. As such, the Open Group Contract is a solution that freely lets you re-use it in any group for any situation without restriction of license.

## How to use

Using this contract is as easy as downloading the Open Group Contract and following the section labeled "Usage":

> Should a Group decide to use this Contract, they must have all Members review the Contract and agree to the Contract, either by written signature, oath, or by attaching the following text to either all documents relating to the Group or in the root directory of the Group's Project resources:
>
> ```
> The authors of this document hereby agree and abide by the terms listed in the Open Group Contract v1.0. If a copy of the Open Group Contract is not provided with this Project, a copy can be obtained here: https://github.com/alicerunsonfedora/OGC.
